# Documentation of the journey to building this product
In my notion template I will be including everything that I go through in this process of bringing this app to life. I tried to make everything as simple and easy to understand as possible, so hopefully what I'm making here does achieve that goal. --This is my first ever project I have no idea I'm doing I don't even know what a README is I'm literally following a Youtube tutorial so you'll be seeing everything I learn as a beginner through the development of this product. I definitely more than welcome any feedback. I'll do my best to keep everything simple and update regularly! My goal here is to build something I know I will use and to make programming more fun, rather than just building calculator apps and to do lists. 

I just did some very quick research on the frameworks and libraries I will need to learn to make this project a reality, I haven't used any of these. I may be way out of my league, but hopefully through the next few months we can all see my progress slowly (feel free to cook me if I start slacking). The planned roadmaps and tech stack may definitely change according to what I learn along the way.

Here is the notion template, feel free to have a look around!: <a href="https://www.notion.so/Market-Knowledge-1fe1569a7d788035ad70ce8383d64a45?pvs=4">Template</a>
